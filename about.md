              The Trustworthy Software Ecosystems Lab at Purdue Universityâ€™s Electrical and Computer Engineering
              Department focuses on analyzing and securing the ecosystems in which software is developed, packaged,
              tested and distributed to users. We believe that protecting the environment in which software is created
              is as fundamental as the intrinsic security of the software itself. As such, we focus on studying aspects
              such as:
