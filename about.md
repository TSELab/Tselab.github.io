The Trustworthy Software Ecosystems Lab at Purdue University's Electrical and
Computer Engineering Department focuses on analysing and securing the
ecosystems in which software is developed, packaged, tested and distributed to
users. We believe that protecting the environment in which software is created
is as fundamental as the intrinsic security of the software itself. As such, we
focus on studying aspects such as:

- The software supply chain (from the version control system to the delivery
  pipeline)
- The certification ecosystem (from code signing certificates to peer-to-peer
  authentication)
- The eveloper identity and their community trust
- The societal interactions between developers on open source and its efect on
  code quality
