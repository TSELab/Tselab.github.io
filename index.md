title: Trustworthy Software Ecosystems (TSE) Lab.
---

The Trustworthy Software Ecosystems lab at Purdue's Electrical and Computer
Engineering department focuses on analysing and protecting the various ways
that people create and consume software. To do so, we create systems such as
in-toto to protect the software supply chain, develop new techniques to analyse
software in the wild, and measure the software ecosystems and how they evolve.

> If you're a prospective Purdue student and are interested in working in the
> TSE, please reach out to [Santiago Torres-Arias](https://badhomb.re) about it!
